# 🧼 A Statistical and Exploratory Analysis of Handwashing and Maternal Mortality
## A Data-Driven Analysis Inspired by Ignaz Semmelweis
## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes one of the most important discoveries in medical history: **how mandatory handwashing dramatically reduced maternal mortality rates** in 19th-century hospitals.

Using historical hospital data, I applied **exploratory data analysis, statistical testing, and data visualization** to quantify the impact of hand hygiene on death rates. The project demonstrates how data, when clearly visualized and rigorously analyzed, can challenge established beliefs and support life-saving decisions.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze maternal death rates **before and after** the introduction of mandatory handwashing.
- Visually and statistically validate whether handwashing had a **significant impact**.
- Demonstrate how **data visualization and statistics** support evidence-based decision-making.

## 📊 Key Techniques & Concepts

### Data Analysis & Visualization
- Histograms to visualize distributions  
- Overlaid histograms for comparing unequal sample sizes  
- Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) for smooth distribution analysis  
- Boundary-aware KDEs for proportion-based data  
- Time series visualization with highlighted intervention periods  
- Customized legends and annotations using Matplotlib  

### Statistical Analysis
- Independent two-sample *t-test*  
- Interpretation of *t-statistics* and *p-values*  
- Statistical significance testing using SciPy  

### Data Processing
- Conditional feature engineering using NumPy’s `where()`  
- Vectorized operations for efficient computation

## 🧪 Statistical Insight
The analysis confirms that the reduction in mortality rates following the introduction of handwashing is **statistically significant** and **not due to random variation**.  
This converts observational patterns into **quantitative statistical evidence**.

## 🧠 Why This Project Matters
Despite strong empirical evidence, early findings supporting handwashing were initially rejected due to:
- Poor communication of results  
- Lack of effective visualizations  
- Resistance to statistical reasoning in medicine  

This project reinforces a critical modern lesson:

> **Data alone is not enough — clarity, visualization, and statistical reasoning are essential for impact.**

It also highlights how failures in communication can delay progress, even when human lives are at stake.

## 📈 Outcomes
- Clear visual separation of death-rate distributions before and after intervention  
- Strong statistical evidence supporting the effectiveness of handwashing  
- A reproducible workflow demonstrating real-world data analysis practices  

---

## 🕊 Historical Context
Although the original findings were not immediately accepted, later advancements in germ theory validated the importance of hand hygiene. Today, handwashing remains one of the most fundamental practices in modern medicine.
